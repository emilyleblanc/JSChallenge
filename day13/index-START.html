    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = 'mike'
    console.log(team2);
    
    // one way
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[0] = 'jon'
    console.log(team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = 'ben'
    console.log(team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    console.log(person);

    // and think we make a copy:

    const person2 = {...person};
    person2.name = 'Emily LeBlanc';
    console.log(person2);


    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 2});
    console.log(person3);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
